        <h2>What is coding</h2>
        <p>Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with 
            computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code 
            is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, 
            you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. 
            You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, 
            and do lots of other cool things.</p>
            <h2>Why learn how to code?</h2>
            <p>We all have hopes, dreams, and plans for the future. Whether you are 
                looking for a new opportunity, want to optimize your current job, 
                or are simply searching for a new hobby, coding can help you get 
                closer to your goals. And remember, anyone can learn how to code!</p>
